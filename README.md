## Using This to Run Mods

You will want to install the [Cursed Fabric MultiMC Instance](https://github.com/calmilamsy/Cursed-Fabric-MultiMC) and [download the latest release of StationAPI](https://github.com/modificationstation/StationAPI/releases/latest).  
Put the downloaded StationAPI jar into your mods folder, do NOT add as a jar mod.
